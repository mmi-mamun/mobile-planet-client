### Use of technologies in this project:
__*Framework: Tailwind*__
Tailwind CSS is a low-level framework. Meaning, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, Tailwind doesnâ€™t offer fully styled components like buttons, dropdowns, and navbars. Instead, it offers utility classes so you can create your own reusable components.

For that reason, it provides a lot more flexibility and control over what your application looks like than other CSS frameworks. This can enable you to create a more unique site


_*Component Library: Daisy UI*_
It's a themeable UI components library. It is a plugin for Tailwind CSS. Faster development, Cleaner HTML, Customizable and themeable. Pure CSS. Works on all frameworks. I used many attractive features and component from *Daisy UI*


## Conclusion
_Finally, I can fulfil this project by 4 days working. I think it would be attractive for all users. This project will be update if needed_
